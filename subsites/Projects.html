                <h2>Home Defender</h2>
                <p>People often say that the best learning comes from hands-on projects, which is why I embarked on a major project in 2021: My Homedefender. 
				This was my first significant personal project. The inspiration came from a video by Michael Reeves, an American YouTuber. After watching it, 
				I noticed some clear flaws in his design. That sparked the idea to create a similar device but with the added feature of human detection. 
				You can see the result in the video on the left.

                <h2>journeyman's examination</h2>
                <p>For my final project in my apprenticeship as an IT Systems Electrician, I was tasked with constructing an experimental laboratory focused on network technology. The goal was to set up a network consisting of three separate segments: a private network for trainees to connect with their computers, a DMZ (demilitarized zone) for hosting a web server and file server, and a public network for accessing internet services.
					I used a Dell Optiplex 755 with three network cards as the router, running the fli4l distribution. In the event of a power outage, both the servers and the router were backed up by a UPS (uninterruptible power supply). Samba was used to manage file sharing on the file server, while Apache was used for the web server. For enhanced connectivity, I implemented OpenVPN.
					Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience, and the network continued to operate successfully for the following five years.

                <h2>My Professional Video</h2>
                <p>As part of a required project to graduate from high school, I chose to focus on computer science, given my long-standing interest 
		in games. My idea was to create a game that incorporated the physics formulas we had learned throughout the school year, 
		but without using Unity's built-in rigid body system. The formulas primarily revolved around gravity, as demonstrated in the video beside this text.
				This project gave me valuable insights into how the Unity engine works and helped deepen my understanding of the year's physics concepts.

                <h2>Cocktail Mix Machine</h2>
                <p>In 2023, we had the opportunity to design, build, and program a Cocktail Mixing Machine as part of a university project. 
		The previous machine was broken and wouldn't be ready in time for the upcoming freshman party, so a group of seven students, including myself, 
		was selected to create a new and improved version. Our concept for the new machine included a compact assembly line setup, unlike the two previous models, 
		which were static and limited in functionality due to space constraints. My specific role in the project was to program the connected B&R PLC using structured text, 
		ensuring smooth operation and integration of all components.
